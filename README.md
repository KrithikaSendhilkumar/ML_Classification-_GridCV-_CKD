This repository contains a machine learning classification project aimed at predicting the presence of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) based on patient health metrics. The project explores multiple ML algorithms and uses GridSearchCV for hyperparameter optimization to identify the best model.

 🔍 Problem Statement
Chronic Kidney Disease is a serious health condition that requires early detection for effective treatment. This project leverages supervised learning techniques to classify whether a patient is likely to have CKD based on clinical data.
