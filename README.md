# ML_Classification-_GridCV-_CKD
A machine learning-based classification project to predict Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) using multiple algorithms including SVC, Random Forest, Decision Tree, KNN, Na√Øve Bayes variants, and Logistic Regression. Hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV was employed to identify the best-performing model.
